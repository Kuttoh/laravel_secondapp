    <p>
        The iPad Pro has received a big makeover for 2018, with a new edge-to-edge liquid retina LCD display,
        an A12X Bionic chip (which can outperform Intel-based laptops) and a new version of the Apple Pencil that
        attaches to the side of the iPad magnetically, with wireless charging. The result? Our pick for the best
        tablet with a stylus on the market right now.
